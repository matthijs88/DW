TOTO,Africa ,4525402,  Verse 1 David Paich I hear the drums echoing tonight But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation Shes coming in 1230 flight Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation I stopped an old man along the way Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies He turned to me as if to say Hurry boy its waiting there for you  Chorus Bobby Kimball Its gonna take a lot to drag me away from you Theres nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do I bless the rains down in Africa Gonna take some time to do the things we never had  Verse 2 David Paich The wild dogs cry out in the night As they grow restless longing for some solitary company I know that I must do whats right As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti I seek to cure whats deep inside Frightened of this thing that Ive become  Chorus Bobby Kimball Its gonna take a lot to drag me away from you Theres nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do I bless the rains down in Africa Gonna take some time to do the things we never had  Bridge Hurry boy shes waiting there for you  Chorus Bobby Kimball Its gonna take a lot to drag me away from you Theres nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do I bless the rains down in Africa I bless the rains down in Africa I bless the rains down in Africa I bless the rains down in Africa I bless the rains down in Africa Gonna take some time to do the things we never had  ,0.063,0.844,0.092,0.8885
