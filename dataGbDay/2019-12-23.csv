Ella Fitzgerald,Frosty The Snowman ,68659,  Frosty the snowman Was a jolly happy soul With a corncob pipe and a button nose And two eyes made out of coal  Frosty the snowman Is a fairytale they say He was made of snow But the children know  How he came to life one day There must have been some magic In that old silk hat they found For when they placed it on his head  He began to dance around Frosty the snowman Was alive as he could be And the children say  He could laugh and play Just the same as you and me Frosty the snowman Knew the sun was hot that day  So he said lets run And well have some fun Now before I melt away Down to the village  With a broomstick in his hand Running here and there all around the square Saying catch me if you can He led them down the streets of town  Right to the traffic cop And he only paused a moment when He heard him holler stop Frosty the snowman  Had to hurry on his way But he waved goodbye Saying dont you cry Ill be back again some day  Thumpety thump thump Thumpety thump thump Look at frosty go Thumpety thump thump Thumpety thump thump Over the hills of snow  ,0.01,0.882,0.109,0.97
