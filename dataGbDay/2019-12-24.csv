Johnny Mathis,When a Child Is Born ,105781,  A ray of hope flickers in the sky A tiny star lights up way up high All across the land dawns a brand new morn This comes to pass when a child is born  A silent wish sails the seven seas The winds of change whisper in the trees And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn This comes to pass when a child is born  A rosy hue settles all around Youve got the feel youre on solid ground For a spell or two noone seems forlorn This comes to pass when a child is born  And all of this happens because the world is waiting Waiting for one child Black white yellow noone knows But a child that will grow up and turn tears to laughter Hate to love war to peace and everyone to everyones neighbour And misery and suffering will be words to be forgotten forever  Its all a dream an illusion now It must come true sometime soon somehow All across the land dawns a brand new morn This comes to pass when a child is born  ,0.114,0.772,0.115,0.0516
