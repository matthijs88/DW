Lauv,There's No Way (feat. Julia Michaels) ,201065,  Verse 1 Lauv You touch me and it’s almost like we knew That there will be history between us two We knew someday that we would have regrets But we just ignored them the night we met We just dance backwards into each other Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered You touch me and it’s almost like we knew That there will be history  Chorus Lauv  Julia Michaels But there’s no way that it’s not going there With the way that we’re looking at each other There’s no way that it’s not going there Every second with you I want another But maybe we could hold off for one sec So we could keep this tension in check But there’s no way that it’s not going there With the way that we’re looking at each other  Verse 2 Julia Michaels Lauv  Both I wish I could make the time stop So we could forget everything and everyone I wish that the time would line up So we could just give in to what we want Cause when I got somebody you dont And when you got somebody I dont I wish that the time would line up So we could just give in  Chorus Lauv  Julia Michaels But there’s no way that it’s not going there Going its not going there With the way that we’re looking at each other There’s no way that it’s not going there Going its not going there Every second with you I want another But maybe we could hold off for one sec So we could keep this tension in check But there’s no way that it’s not going there Going its not going there With the way that we’re looking at each other  Bridge Lauv  Julia Michaels We just dance backwards into each other Tryna keep our feelings secretly covered We just dance backwards into each other We just keep on dancing Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered Right into each other You touched me and its almost like we knew That there would be history  Chorus Lauv  Julia Michaels But there’s no way that it’s not going there Going its not going there With the way that we’re looking at each other There’s no way that it’s not going there Going its not going there Every second with you I want another But maybe we could hold off for one sec So we could keep this tension in check But there’s no way that it’s not going there Going its not going there With the way that we’re looking at each other  Outro Lauv  Julia Michaels We just keep on dancing right into each other We just keep on dancing right into each other  ,0.077,0.881,0.042,-0.9425
