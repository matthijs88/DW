Eminem,'Till I Collapse ,201340,  Intro Eminem Cause sometimes you just feel tired feel weak Yo left yo left yo left right left And when you feel weak Yo left You feel like you wanna just give up Yo left yo left But you gotta search within you Right left Try to find that inner strength Yo left yo left And just pull that shit out of you Yo left And get that motivation to not give up Right left yo left And not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall Yo left yo left right left Flat on your face and collapse  Verse 1 Eminem Til I collapse Im spillin these raps long as you feel em Til the day that I drop youll never say that Im not killin em ‘Cause when I am not then Ima stop pennin em And I am not hiphop and Im just not Eminem Subliminal thoughts when Ima stop sendin em Women are caught in webs spin em and hock venom Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin to stop Amoxicillins just not real enough The criminal copkillin hiphop villain A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners Youre comin with me feel it or not Youre gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us You hear it a lot lyrics to shock Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin up Fo shizzle my wizzle this is the plot listen up You bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a fuck  Chorus Nate Dogg Til the roof comes off til the lights go out Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth Til the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse Until the roof Til the roof comes off til the lights go out The roof comes off Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth Until my legs Til the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps Give out from underneath me Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse  Verse 2 Eminem Music is like magic theres a certain feelin you get When you real and you spit and people are feelin your shit This is your moment and every single minute you spend Tryna hold on to it cause you may never get it again So while youre in it try to get as much shit as you can And when your run is over just admit when its at its end Cause Im at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in I got a list heres the order of my list that its in It goes Reggie JayZ 2Pac and Biggie André from OutKast Jada Kurupt Nas and then me But in this industry Im the cause of a lot of envy So when Im not put on this list the shit does not offend me Thats why you see me walk around like nothings botherin me Even though half you people got a fuckin problem with me You hate it but you know respect you got to give me The presss wet dream like Bobby and Whitney — Nate hit me  Chorus Nate Dogg Til the roof comes off til the lights go out Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth Til the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse Until the roof Til the roof comes off til the lights go out The roof comes off Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth Until my legs Til the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps Give out from underneath me Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse  Verse 3 Eminem Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MCs heart What is he thinking How not to go against me smart And its absurd how people hang on every word Ill probly never get the props I feel I ever deserve But Ill never be served my spot is forever reserved If I ever leave Earth that would be the death of me first ‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin could ever be worse Thats why Im clever when I put together every verse My thoughts are sporadic I act like Im an addict I rap like Im addicted to smack like Im Kim Mathers But I dont wanna go forth and back in constant battles The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers So this is like a fullblown attack Im launchin at em The track is on some battlin raps who wants some static ‘Cause I dont really think that the fact that Im Slim matters A plaque and platinum status is whack if Im not the baddest so  Chorus Nate Dogg Til the roof comes off til the lights go out Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth Til the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse Until the roof Til the roof comes off til the lights go out The roof comes off Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth Until my legs Til the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps Give out from underneath me Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse  Outro Eminem  Nate Dogg Until the roof Until the roof The roof comes off The roof comes off Until my legs Until my legs Give out from Underneath me I I will not fall I will stand tall Feels like no one can beat me  ,0.105,0.82,0.075,-0.9926
